# Blockchain Geographies

This is a repository for my PhD research and its associated NSF grant.

## Blockchain Miners

This set of scripts intends to gather as much geospatial information on the miner network for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. This largely involves auditing available APIs for mining pools and mining resource forums.

## Blockchain Networks

This set of scripts intends to gather and structure bitcoin transactions into graphs of transaction networks. Nodes and edges are initially coded with data available on the blockchain, but may include additional information from specific web crawls per hash.
